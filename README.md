# SpaceX Clone with ReactJS

A SpaceX Clone application built with ReactJS that allows users to explore SpaceX rockets and capsules. This project includes a modern landing page with three main sections: Banner, Search Form, and Data Grid. It also utilizes an authorized REST API built with Node.js for fetching and sending data between SpaceX and the application.
